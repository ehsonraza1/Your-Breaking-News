# Project 1



## Project Proposal
1. Create the Github Repo per instructions in Activity 1 & Activity 2
    - The master branch of the repo must be protected
    - You can branch via personal branching strategy
        - One branch per group member
    - Or with Git Flow/Feature Branching
    - Personal branching strategy is easiest
2. In the Readme of the Github repo
   Follow the GoodReadme Guide in 01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental
   Add the description for your project
   Add a section above Installation called Developers
   List your group members

   Consider including LinkedIn Links, Portfolio Links, Github links
   Add a section below developers called Technologies
   List the APIs, CSS Framework you plan on using


## Notes on presentaion requirements from class on Wednesday, May 27th.

We will give 10 minute long (total for the group) presentation of our projec. No Powerpoin presentations, run demo.  We need to show functionaluty and convey to our audience why our product is better than other similar websites and why.

Questions we need to answer:
1. What's so special about our project?
2. Why they should want our news site?
3. What kind of problem we solved with our website? 
4. Don't tell what we didn't do. Tell what we want to improve (future development). 
5. Sell them on our idea. 


Main things to focus on (it's all in project requirements):
Oveall, pitch like we are pitching a product. 
* features of our project, no talks about algoritm, don't go too technical;
* setbacks, problems and challenges we had;
* future development (personalized news feed? subscription? something else??);

Questions during presentaion (see questions we need to answer above).
